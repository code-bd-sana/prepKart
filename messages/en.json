        "question": "Can I adjust recipes for allergies or dietary restrictions?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. During setup, you can specify allergies, intolerances, and dietary preferences (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian, etc.). Our smart system automatically excludes unsuitable ingredients and suggests alternatives. You can also manually swap any recipe in your plan."
