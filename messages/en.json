    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Is Prepcart available across Canada?",
        "answer": "Yes! Prepcart works anywhere in Canada. Our grocery integration supports major retailers like Walmart, Loblaws, Metro, Sobeys, and Costco, with real-time pricing and availability based on your postal code. We also adjust meal recommendations for regional availability and seasonal produce."
      },
      {
        "question": "How are meal plans generated?",
        "answer": "Prepcart uses smart meal planning technology to create personalized meal plans based on your dietary preferences, budget, family size, and cooking time. Our system balances nutrition, minimizes ingredient waste through smart ingredient overlap, and accounts for seasonal availability. You can regenerate plans until you find the perfect fit."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I adjust recipes for allergies or dietary restrictions?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. During setup, you can specify allergies, intolerances, and dietary preferences (gluten-free, dairy-free, vegetarian, etc.). Our smart system automatically excludes unsuitable ingredients and suggests alternatives. You can also manually swap any recipe in your plan."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Instacart required to use Prepcart?",
        "answer": "No, Instacart is optional. While we offer seamless integration with Instacart for one-click grocery ordering, you can also use Prepcart to generate shopping lists and shop manually at any store. The app helps you compare prices across retailers regardless of how you choose to shop."
